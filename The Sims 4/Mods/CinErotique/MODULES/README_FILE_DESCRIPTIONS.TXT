            WHAT ARE GAMEPLAY MODULES AND HOW TO ENABLE/DISABLE THEM
================================================================================
Gameplay MODULES represent mod features that can be individually enabled or 
disabled based on your personal gameplay preferences. For example, you might
not like the overly powerful 'Flirty+4' buff your sim receives every time after
watching porn on the TV, or you're not particularly fond of having certain TV
channels to be in your game.

Note that this MODULE management feature is totally optional, the mod works just
fine with the default settings, I just wanted to include the option for users to
be able to customize their in-game experience in case they wanted to.

For detailed description on what each MODULE do, please refer to the included
'README_file_descriptions.txt' in the MODULES folder.

HOW TO ENABLE/DISABLE MODULES:
------------------------------
You can disable MODULES by changing the files' extension from '.package' to 
'.off', and vice versa to turn them back on.

So, for example to turn the 'More Pie Menu Icons" MODULE off, rename the
PECO_MODULE_OVERRIDE_more_pie_menu_icons.package file to
PECO_MODULE_OVERRIDE_more_pie_menu_icons.off

NOTES:
------
When you turn a MODULE off, it will be GLOBALLY DISABLED in the game, not just
for a particular save or played family!
